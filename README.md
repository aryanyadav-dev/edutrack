## Authentication Workflow
1. **Login:**
   - User enters email and password.
   - If credentials are valid, a JWT token is issued.

2. **Role-Based Access:**
   - The JWT token is decoded to determine the user's role (Student or Professor).
   - The frontend renders the appropriate dashboard based on the role.
